# PersianWordEmbeddings

**A Persian NLP project for building co-occurrence matrices, computing word similarities, and visualizing word embeddings with PCA.**

---

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Persian Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and provides the following features:

- Build a **co-occurrence matrix** with a configurable window size  
- Compute **cosine similarity between words**  
- Find **most similar words** for a given target word  
- **Visualize word embeddings** using PCA with the ability to select a target word and the number of similar words  
- **Interactive GUI** built with Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for easy user interaction  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Full support for Persian text with correct **RTL rendering**  
- Adjustable parameters: number of samples, window size, number of similar words  
- **Interactive PCA plots** using Plotly  
- Efficient computation using **Sparse Matrices**
